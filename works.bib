@article{WillatsSFN2015,
abstract = {Abstract: Since the advent of optogenetics, there has been ever-growing interest in applying this technology to the control of neural activity. However, factors such as variable opsin expression, differential distribution of light, and spontaneous neural states make robust control of neural activity intractable with open loop stimulation. To overcome these limitations, we have engineered a system for closed-loop control of neural activity which combines single-unit thalamic recording and optogenetic stimulation through real-time interfacing in the rat vibrissa system in-vivo. Beyond allowing the experimenter to overcome unknown factors in the response of an opsin to light, closed loop control allows for decoupling of causally related variables such as firing rate and temporal precision. Previously, we demonstrated successful control of firing rate in single neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPm) of the anesthetized rat using PI control. The controller operates on the error between the instantaneous firing rate and a target rate; the resulting control signal is used to modulate the intensity of light (470 nm, LED) conducted to VPM via optic fiber, thereby stimulating opsin-expressing cells in VPm. We have demonstrated the ability to follow target firing rates precisely, decoupling the magnitude of the firing rate from the statistics of the firing in the VPm. Furthermore, we can extend this framework to address the control of more complicated, dynamic firing rate trajectories. Closed loop control of firing rate to follow dynamic trajectories would enable precise characterization of sensory encoding in different neural contexts, such as oscillatory activity. To this end, we have tuned and characterized our system's ability to achieve sinusoidal trajectories. In assessing the capabilities of the original system outside the realm of static trajectories, we first carried out a system identification of the controller experimentally using step inputs, discrete sinusoids, and white noise as targets for the system. We found that the experimental system was limited by the transformation of the firing rate signal from a discrete representation of spikes to a continuous estimate of instantaneous firing rate. To systematically explore controller parameters in an environment that is not limited by experimental recording time, we developed a simulated model of the closed loop controller interacting with a single neuron. Consistent with the experimental results, a sensitivity analysis of the simulated system parameters implicates the firing rate transformation as a critical parameter affecting the ability to follow arbitrary waveforms.},

abstract = {mmediate Early Genes (IEGs) are rapidly and transiently transcribed in neurons after a sensory experience. Some of these genes act as effector IEGs, which mediate specific effects on cellular function. Arc is one such effector IEG that is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation in hippocampus and cortex. The expression of Arc in neurons has previously been examined using an imaging method known as Compartmental Analysis of Temporal Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization. Previous work found that the time course of Arc expression within the nuclear and perinuclear cytoplasmic compartments of a neuron is altered by prior sensory experience. We explore a simple model of the kinetics of IEG transcription and nuclear export, with the aim of eventually uncovering possible mechanisms for how experience alters expression kinetics. Thus far, we characterize our compartmental model using phase-plane analysis and validate it against several IEG expression data sets, including one where prior experience with vocalizing mice alters the time course of call-induced Arc expression in the auditory cortex of a listening mouse. Our model provides a framework to explore why Arc expression may change depending on a receiver's past sound experience and internal state.},
